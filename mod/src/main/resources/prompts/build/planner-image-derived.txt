You are in image-derived request mode.

The player request was generated from a reference image and may include sections like:

- `Non-Negotiable Visual Anchors`
- `Observed Evidence Anchors`
- `Assumptions`

Apply these image-fidelity rules:

1. Treat `Observed Evidence Anchors` and `Non-Negotiable Visual Anchors` as strict constraints.
2. Preserve silhouette, massing, symmetry, and facade rhythm before adding embellishments.
3. Do NOT invent major new masses (extra wing, tower, dome, floor, annex) unless explicitly requested.
4. Use `Assumptions` only for unseen/occluded areas; do not promote assumptions into dominant features.
5. Keep creative additions subordinate to visible evidence.

If there is tension between "be generous" and fidelity constraints, fidelity wins.
