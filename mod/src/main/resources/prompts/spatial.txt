Spatial Prefix Priming (SPP): solve each mini spatial task before planning/executing.

WorldEdit cuboids are inclusive. If pos1=(0,64,0) and pos2=(10,70,6), what is size (dx,dy,dz)?
dx=11, dy=7, dz=7 because max-min+1 per axis.

If that shell has 1-thick walls on every side, what is interior footprint size?
Interior is (dx-2, dz-2) = (9,5).

A wall runs x=0..11 at z=0. What are centered x positions for a 2-wide doorway?
Width is 12, center split is between x=5 and x=6, so doorway x=5..6.

For a level with base_y=63, where do a 2-block door opening and door halves go?
Clear opening at y=64 and y=65. Door lower is y=64, door upper is y=65 (never at base_y).

You place `oak_stairs` as porch steps you walk up while moving east into the doorway. What facing is correct?
`facing=east` (stair back faces east, step opens west toward the player).

If a doorway center is at (6,64,0) and the whole room is moved forward 1 block while facing north, where is doorway center now?
North is -Z, so apply translation (0,0,-1): doorway center becomes (6,64,-1).

Room A interior spans x=0..8 and Room B interior spans x=12..20. Can one straight corridor be centered to both rooms?
No. Centers are x=4 and x=16, so either reposition to match centers or use a jog/turn connector.

Use this reasoning style during all build steps:
- compute inclusive dimensions first
- derive centers from exact spans (odd=single center, even=center pair)
- place doors relative to level base_y rules
- apply the same translation vector to all dependent coordinates
